                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Foundation: <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">My initial question I attempted to address was, &quot;How does nature affect humans?&quot; It was a time consuming and difficult process to find a definite answer; this process is what will be described below. In the practice of creating my very own website filled with photos, poems, and details of my own life it became apparent to me that my question wasn't sufficient. My question evolved into, &quot;How can I enhance my experience in nature?&quot; it became this because I wanted to use photography and literature to slow down my thought process and fine tune my brain to look further into nature and appreciate its finer less obvious details. I've always been fairly outdoorsy but using literature and photography to enhance my experience wasn't easy to learn. Writing often comes down to details most especially in the case of poetry. To improve my poetry and writing in general it was necessary to become better at analyzing things as much as possible. To better my poetry I also needed to better my photography. With a broader skill set in photography it would be much easier to study photos and moments in deeper detail, which would in turn broaden my description, and imagery in poetry. I began by using a go pro in the water during my trips to the beach on the weekends and slowly progressed to different types of cameras and sceneries. In this reflection I will assess my progress through learning photography and bettering my skills at converting image details into words and poetry.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Assess:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">The Product:<span class="style"> <br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">My final product is a website which displays all of the finalized products of my effort. My finalized website meets every expectation I had coming into this project and more. While its appearance may have progressed throughout my work, all my initial goals were fulfilled. I feel my website is quality because of it is aesthetically pleasing while also offering a practical experience to the viewer. I put a good deal of effort into making sure every page looked professional and well done. I took into account a lot of advice and critique from classmates and family members to make an experience on my website a more positive one; from little things like titling all my photos in an interesting manner to bigger things such as adding whole pages or sections to the site. Another quality aspect of the site is that it offers a way to view solely my photos or view my personal favorite photos along with my poetry. I decided to make a photo gallery along with a whole other page for poetry and photos because I figured instead of only putting up 5 photos to go with my 5 poems I would include a larger spectrum of photos to make my website more interesting. In general I feel that the organization and flow of the website promotes a more positive and relaxed vibe which improves the quality of browsing photos and poems just as I intended it to. The poems paired with my favorite photos also came out very well. While the quantity of poems didn't reach my initial goal, the quality greatly exceeded that which I set out to create. I think the poems came out very well because they tied together with visuals in very good synergy. Adding a cover photo to the poetry blog entries added to the quality of each entry since the reader could also have a visual representation to aid in the thought process drawn out with each poem. The only portion of my project that fell short of my earliest goals is the physical properties of the project. I set out to make a book that I could show to relatives or friends but with a website I'm hindered by Wi-Fi and Internet connection; using a web host for my project is both a blessing and a curse in this manner. With more time given for this project I would add more photos a poems. With these things being said about web hosting and more time, here is another quality of my project; since all of my website's content is backed up online it is no trouble to add more to the site. Even after this project ends I hope I will find the motivation to add photos and maybe even write more poems. When I was told to choose a project that ties in with my interests I truly did choose a topic that I love. In choosing nature I fully understood that motivation and material to do this project would not be difficult to find. Having so much motivation makes my project more quality since I have devoted more time and effort than any project I have ever done before. In regards to the product I will be turning in tomorrow, I could of course improve with more time by adding more entries, photos, and other details. I do however feel that the current entries I have submitted are well versed and portray my best effort and work. In conclusion I'm happy with what I have created. I'm highly reminded of my makana project from last year in which I spent tons of hours creating a paipo board, and felt like I was being tortured until I stepped back to look at the results; I found myself surprisingly content.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">The Process:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4">Step-by-step walkthrough:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">The beach, where it all began:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">The roots of this very project began growing from the beach. For over a year now I have been going to the beach every weekend or whenever I have the chance to. Whether it be surfing, bodyboarding, photography, or just relaxing all of my best memories for the past year have been there. When we were first assigned this project my initial reaction was something crazy, &quot;Damn, this is great, I'm totally gonna make a huge surfboard!&quot; I quickly changed my sky high expectation when I realized the project was worth a huge chunk of my English grade… The next thing that came to mind was a project at the beach. I debated between a bodyboarding documentary or a film but struggled to find a connection with that and English. My final conclusion was made after looking through old cycle papers, and finding a mediocre poem I submitted but was too lazy to revise. With new found inspiration my final epiphany was the use of photography. Very recently my friend had gotten a go pro which took pretty mediocre quality video. I figured with a little technique and practice I could take even better shots than him (just kidding).<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5">Photography, where inspiration happens:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Before even beginning to strategize and think about how I would present my project I wanted to learn how to take good pictures. My biggest inspiration to improve my wave photography was and still is Clark Little. Looking at his pictures I can't imagine many other things that are so naturally beautiful. Its hard to fathom how far photography has come and I think people like Clark Little really exceed and strive to push the boundaries that hinder photography. Capturing a single perfect moment inside a glassy barrel is no easy task especially in the brutal conditions Clark often must endure. I spent a lot of time looking through his Instagram feed and anticipating his new photos. By observing his shots I got a better understanding of positioning and shutter timing. My first attempts were rather futile and in an effort to capture my friend's bodyboarding I often screwed up timing and positioning. Sometimes I would go over the falls and get pounded only to realize later, I didn’t even get the shot! After tanking waves like mad and getting held under until I panicked, I finally got the timing and positioning down to a reasonable quality. Some of the shots I got I was so proud that I had to show them off to my relatives and friends. Besides Clark Little I also watched youtube videos and read tutorials on go pro technique and fundamentals. The concept seems easy, and while it is simple it also can prove to be difficult at times; When a wave is about to break right on top of me my instinct is to dive under rather than risking getting pounded for maybe one shot. Perhaps the most satisfying part of wave photography is the feeling I get when I capture a glassy barrel. When the shot is right and everything just aligns there is no lcd screen to confirm the shot, but I get a sense of accomplishment knowing I probably got a good shot. Through the many visits to the beach I became more and more comfortable and now a days Sandy Beach almost feels like a second home.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5">Poetry, where the deep analysis is done:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">My goal to create multiple poems a week was also scrapped. I decided on this because of a simple saying, &quot;Quality over quantity&quot;. I discussed with some of my parents and friends about their opinion and they agreed that a few quality poems would be better than a multitude of mediocre poems. While the amount of actual typing I would be doing would decrease, the amount of effort and thought put into each individual poem would require almost an equal amount of time. I still stand by this idea because I feel that what I have created meets a much higher standard than what I would have wrote if I had to write a large quantity. Finally it came time to write up my first poem, using the knowledge of imagery and description that I already had would be insufficient for what I set my goal so I decided to get help from the writing center along with a few of my past teachers. It was also helpful to reference famous nature poets whose writing and poetry would serve as a guideline and inspiration to my own. Some stand out poets include:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Robert Frost<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Emily Dickenson<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6">Walt Whitman <br />Langston Hughes <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">In all honesty I highly disliked reading poetry. Poetry, while providing a lot of detail and describing beautiful images always seemed a bit slow paced to read for my liking. To help make poetry more interesting for me I tried to read it before bed when I my mind was tired and unwilling to read other fast paced drama. Poetry helped me relax and also improved my ability to convey images to readers through description and the use of proper vocabulary.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">I spent some good quality time studying and enjoying the works of famous poets, but it is one thing to be able to analyze work and another to create my own. Many elements of my poems are derived from the great poets I mentioned above. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Walt Whitman had perhaps the most impactful poetry and style of writing. In his poem, &quot;Give me the Silent Splendid Sun&quot; he incorporated many interesting techniques. Here is a short excerpt, <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">&quot; G<span style="line-height: 16px; " class="style_1">IVE</span> me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams full-dazzling;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8"> <span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Give me juicy autumnal fruit, ripe and red from the orchard;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8"> <span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Give me a field where the unmow’d grass grows;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_8"> <span style="line-height: 19px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7">Give me an arbor, give me the trellis’d grape;&quot; (Walt Whitman)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_7"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">I found it particularly that he used silent, a sense of hearing, to describe the sun. In this poem he frequently personifies nature, which I personally enjoyed, as it was interesting to think about. He compares the solitude of nature and the brilliant exciting cities. I particularly enjoyed his philosophical approach to nature so I tried to use this approach in my poems.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Emily Dickenson was often broad and mysterious yet at the same time placed an image into the readers mind, <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_9">&quot;Nature&quot; is what we see—<br />The Hill—the Afternoon—<br />Squirrel—Eclipse— the Bumble bee—<br />Nay—Nature is Heaven—<br />Nature is what we hear—<br />The Bobolink—the Sea—<br />Thunder—the Cricket—<br />Nay—Nature is Harmony—<br />Nature is what we know—<br />Yet have no art to say—<br />So impotent Our Wisdom is<br />To her Simplicity.&quot; (Emily Dickenson)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 32px; " class="style_3"> </span>I was curious as to how such strong imagery could be conveyed without the use of many adjectives and adverbs. I tried incorporating this into my own style of writing by cutting back on lists of descriptive language. I could list adjectives about an apple for example, or I could simply say &quot;an apple&quot;. This would leave the apple up for interpretation by the reader. I found this to be a great technique to &quot;cut fluff&quot; instead of wasting time describing an apple I could let the reader describe the apple for themselves using their own biases that they would develop progressing through my writing. For example, &quot;a rotten stinky half-eaten apple&quot; vs &quot;an apple, buried deep underneath layers of trash and excrement&quot;. Using this style of writing I can allow the poem to be open ended and encourage thought on the readers end. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Robert Frost often uses nature in his poetry to convey a metaphor. In his poem &quot;Birches&quot; he uses Birch trees as sort of a way to ascend into heaven. First he sees the path to heaven (birch trees) as an easy road forged by the play of boys swinging merrily from its branches. Quickly he realizes that it was not boys that had caused the trees to wither; it had been hardships such as storms of ice and fire. Similarly the path to heaven can be battered by challenges and hardships that may at times feel like a storm of ice or fire. The speaker is challenged because he wants to visit heaven but still wishes to live and is not willing to sacrifice his well-lived life for the frail promise of a perfect after life, <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">&quot;the inner dome of heaven has fallen&quot;.  (Birches, Robert Frost)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">This poem became a basis for my own poem &quot;Sky&quot;. I found myself in deep thought about the concept and religious promises of heaven. To convey my feelings about this poem I wrote my own take on heaven, taking Robert Frost's opinion to question and compare my own opinion. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">My first poem I wrote happens to be my favorite. I began with an original old poem I had worked on for my cycle paper, and totally revamped it into something with far more descriptive value than before. I used techniques such as &quot;cutting the fluff&quot;, taught to me by my previous English teacher Mrs. Cheever, to turn my original poem from loosely descriptive to a leaner poem which used words that were carefully chosen to portray an image or detail with the most accuracy. I also used a lot of techniques from Dr. Mitsuda. Remaking my poem I kept in mind the many writing styles of other famous poets and successful writing by my own peers to guide my poetry and ultimately shape my writing style. The final product was lengthy for a poem, but each detail was meticulously planned so there was no waste in words and descriptive factors. I like to think of it as an overweight poem stripped to its bones (bare structure), and then all of its fluff/fat (meaningless words) replaced with leaner more efficient muscle (stronger and more accurate words).<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Patching together the final product:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"> Initially I envisioned a physical book filled with images and corresponding writing. I drew my inspiration from a calligraphy project done by a previous student and shown to me in class. I also set out to make a larger collection of poems. Both of these concepts quickly developed into new, different ideas that still retained my previous motivation. My idea to create a physical book was scrapped, and instead I decided to create something more permanent. I set my mind to making a website that would display my writing and photography, yet still be as aesthetically pleasing as a book. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">After I created my first poem I needed a way to display it. This is when I decided to create a website. My thought process behind this decision was that a website should last forever and cannot be physically damaged; A book is not as ideal because of its susceptibility to water damage and abuse. A website is also more economically friendly and supports a healthy environment which means better photography! Possibly one of the most if not the most difficult tasks of the project was to figure out how to host and setup a website of my own. I began on iWeb using their templates for web design, but quickly realized there was no way to host a website without paying a premium. It took a good deal of research, and finally I found Github which is a website that software designers use to host projects. After setting up my own html files (which I will not go into detail about) it was quite simple to update my website periodically. <br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2">My advice to future sophomores is DON’T PROCRASTINATE. I began my project before the project. I was so grateful that I invested properly distributed hours of work. Evenly distributing your workload is key. I had a lot of friends dying to cram all the work in during the last weekend or even the day before. Also outsource and connect with old teachers or meet new teachers that can help refine your writing. Finally and most importantly choose a topic you do on consistently on at least a weekly basis and thoroughly enjoy!<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Last Words:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5">To conclude I would like to address all my inspirations and motivators that kept me going with this project. I will keep them listed on my website and add more as I meet/learn about them. This project has really opened my eyes to how enjoyable English can actually be. By giving students permission to choose a topic freely Punahou has taken a tremendous risk and I am highly anticipating the results that will be presented soon in class. The quality project is a step in the right direction and can serve a martyr for future learning endeavors. My hats off to you quality project creator!<br /></p>
